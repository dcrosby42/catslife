Intermediate goals:
  / move cat using wasd in addition to arrows
  / reconstitute joystick controller for mobile control
  - put a second cat on screen, use two keyboard controllers
  - use a different sprite / anim for second cat
    SOLVE: Entity creation
  - Echo all controller events through web socket
    (would allow any participant to control either cat, but is ok for now)
  
  OUTPUT EVENTS FROM SIMULATION?

Code maint:

- KeyboardController into own file
- Simulation into own file

- Organize "local" / "world" a little better
