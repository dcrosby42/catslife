catslife
========

A game by Dave and Arwen.

Go fishing.  Buy stuff.  Build a house.  You know, cat stuff!


We're starting out using the Phaser HTML5 game engine, planning to make this a web/mobile multiplayer experience on http://catslife.heroko.com

## Development Prereqs

You need Foreman and NodeJS installed.

    $ cd catslife
    $ foreman start
